		<h1>Declarative languages</h1>
		<p>Declarative languages, also called nonprocedural or very high level, are programming languages in which (ideally) a program specifies what is to be done rather than how to do it. In such languages there is less difference between the specification of a program and its implementation than in the procedural languages described so far. The two common kinds of declarative languages are logic and functional languages.</p>
		<h3>Logic programming languages</h3>
		<p>of which PROLOG (programming in logic) is the best known, state a program as a set of logical relations (e.g., a grandparent is the parent of a parent of someone). Such languages are similar to the SQL database language. A program is executed by an “inference engine” that answers a query by searching these relations systematically to make inferences that will answer a query. PROLOG has been used extensively in natural language processing and other AI programs.</p>
		<h4>Functional languages</h4>
		<p>Functional languages have a mathematical style. A functional program is constructed by applying functions to arguments. Functional languages, such as LISP, ML, and Haskell, are used as research tools in language development, in automated mathematical theorem provers, and in some commercial projects.</p>
